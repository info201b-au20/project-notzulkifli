# Final Project
Use this `REAMDE.md` file to describe your final project (as detailed on Canvas).

* **Why are you interested in this field/domain?**
  * We are interested in health disparities because they make us more aware of inequalities present in the medical world. This is relevant with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and understanding how one person/group’s health and living conditions affect others around them, especially when a group is given more of a “burden” in terms of illness due to differences in resources .

* **What data-driven question do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?**
  * Are areas with people of low economic standing more prone to certain illnesses such as COVID-19, asthma, and diabetes?
  * Do low income areas have access to health resources (hospitals, clinics, Planned Parenthood) close by ( less than 15 miles away)?
  * Are there health disparities present between different ethnicities/races that lead them to have poor healthcare as compared to others?


* **Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?**
  * [US chronic disease indicators](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/us-chronic-disease-indicators-cdi)
  * [COVID19 data dashboard](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/DataDashboard)  
  * [Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/hospitals?geometry=-136.291%2C44.532%2C-105.771%2C49.757)

* **How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?**
  * The data was collected by government agencies acting in their official capacity and surveying the population for questions of interest. These data sets were specifically collected by the Department of Health for Washington state about the prevalence of COVID-19 in Washington, from the CDC about chronic diseases such as Diabetes and Asthma in the US. We also used an Arcgis database that collected and hosted the data in order to find hospitals near people in different states.  
* **How many observations (rows) are in your data?**
  * Individual data point pertaining to the column headers
* **How many features (columns) are in the data?**
  * Health conditions
    * Chronic Illnesses
    * Disease (type)
    * Year illness started - year end
  * Hospitals
    * City
    * Address
    * Zip
    * State
  * Demographics
    * Race / Ethnicity Makeup
    * Gender/ Sex Makeup

* **What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**
  * We believe that all of the questions above can be answered. Using the data collected by the DOH and the CDC, we can establish certain areas where chronic illnesses are more prevalent. We can also cross reference the makeup of those areas with relevant diseases to see if certain demographics such as people under lower economic standings are more prevalent to have these illnesses. Using the hospital database we are able to see if those same low income areas have health resources available to them nearby. Finally, we will use a combination of these two databases along with more sources in order to see if there were health disparities that were present as a result of inadequate resources in those areas.
