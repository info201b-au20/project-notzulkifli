# Final Project
Use this `REAMDE.md` file to describe your final project (as detailed on Canvas).

* Why are you interested in this field/domain?
  * We are interested in health disparities because they make us more aware of inequalities present in the medical world. This is relevant with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and understanding how one person/group’s health and living conditions affect others around them, especially when a group is given more of a “burden” in terms of illness due to differences in resources .  

* What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share **at least 3**)?
  * [Key Facts on Health and Health care by race and Ethnicity](https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/report/key-facts-on-health-and-health-care-by-race-and-ethnicity/)

  * [Health disparities in Snohomish County](https://www.snohd.org/DocumentCenter/View/640/Health-Disparities-in-Snohomish-County-2016-PDF)

* What data-driven question do you hope to answer about this domain (share **at least 3**)?
  * Are areas with people of low economic standing more prone to certain illnesses such as COVID-19, asthma, and diabetes?
  * Do low income areas have access to health resources (hospitals, clinics, Planned Parenthood) close by ( less than 15 miles away)? 
  * Are there health disparities present between different ethnicities/races that lead them to have poor healthcare as compared to others?


* Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
  * [US chronic disease indicators](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/us-chronic-disease-indicators-cdi)
  * [COVID19 data dashboard](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/DataDashboard)

* How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?
* How many observations (rows) are in your data?
  * COVID-19 CASES
  * Chronic Illness
* How many features (columns) are in the data?
* What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
